## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Font Awesome
- JS

### What I learned

This was my first project that really challenged and exposed me to a lot of front-end resources.
I learnt CSS Positioning, Display, Gradients,Flexbox, Responsive Design. I learnt how to import resources into my code, resources such as Google Fonts, Font Awesome for the social media icons.
I also learnt how to create and validate forms.

```html
<h1>Stay productive, wherever you are.</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- I will continue to develop myself in CSS Flexbox and Accessibility.
- I will learn how to write re-useable and concise code.
- Make forms.
- Learn to use CSS Variables in my code.
- Learn CSS Grid.
- Incorporate frameworks in my code.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me with Positioning and Responsive Design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me finally understand gradients and Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
